# CPE 400 Final Project: Network Traffic Analysis of Feit Electric BPA800/RGBW/2 Smart Bulb

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the CPE 400/4001 course, titled **"Network Traffic Analysis of Feit Electric BPA800/RGBW/2 Smart Bulb."** The project aims to analyze the network traffic generated by the Feit Electric BPA800/RGBW/2 smart bulb to identify the protocols used in its communication and determine whether the data was encrypted or transmitted in plaintext.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:
- Identify the protocols used by the smart bulb for communication.
- Determine if the communication was encrypted.
- Analyze the implications of the identified protocols for security and interoperability.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files and documentation:

- **Python Script (`analyze_packets.py`):** 
  - A custom Python script using Scapy and Pandas to analyze packet captures, decode payloads, and identify protocols.
  
- **Packet Capture Files:**
  - Two packet capture files (`.pcap`) containing the network traffic of the smart bulb.
  
- **Analysis Results:**
  - CSV files generated by the Python script containing the analysis results.
  - Log files capturing detailed information about the packets and protocols analyzed.
  
- **Final Project Report (`Final_Project_Report.pdf`):**
  - A comprehensive report detailing the analysis, findings, and conclusions drawn from the project.

## Protocols Identified

During the analysis, the following protocols were identified:

1. **Google Cast Protocol:**
   - Utilized for potential integration with Google-enabled devices, involving media streaming or device control.

2. **Custom Protocol:**
   - A proprietary protocol used by the smart bulb, indicating its reliance on custom communication methods.

## Key Findings

- The smart bulb uses a combination of Google Cast and a proprietary protocol for communication.
- The presence of TLS/SSL handshakes suggests that parts of the communication might be encrypted.
- No explicit command or status markers were found, indicating possible encoding or proprietary representations.

## Future Research Directions

Future research could explore:
- A deeper reverse engineering of the Custom Protocol to understand its structure and data content.
- Further analysis of the Google Cast integration and its implications for security and device interoperability.
- Potential decryption of TLS/SSL traffic to uncover underlying data.

## How to Use

To replicate the analysis or conduct further research:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hotcuppajojo/CPE400FinalProject.git
   cd CPE400FinalProject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install scapy pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis Script:**

   Analyze the packet capture files by running the script:

   ```bash
   python analyze_packets.py <pcap_file>
   ```

4. **Review the Output:**

   - Check the generated CSV and log files for detailed results.
